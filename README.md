**Project Description**

For Project 3 of the TripleTen course, the task was to build a website using HTML and CSS and have it displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. In this project, you'll see the responsive design come into play at the desktop (1280px), tablet (800px), and mobile resolutions (320px). I accomplished this task by leveraging grid display, media queries to adjust the project at certain breakpoints, max-width and other key design functions. I also leveraged Figma to understand the dimensions and properties of different elements used throughout this project.

There is certainly room for improvement within this project. Adding animations to certain elements within the project could bring it more to life and make it more accessible for users while they interact with the webpage, specifically making text or buttons larger on smaller resolution as a user hovers over it or interacts with it to make the element more clear.

Overall, this project was very challenging but rewarding to see it completed. Open to all feedback - feel free to comment!
