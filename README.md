**Project Description**

For Project 3 of the TripleTen course, the task was to build a website using HTML and CSS and have it displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. In this project, you'll see the responsive design come into play at the desktop (1280px), tablet (800px), and mobile resolutions (320px). I accomplished this task by leveraging grid display, media queries to adjust the project at certain breakpoints, max-width and other key design functions. I also leveraged Figma to understand the dimensions and properties of different elements used throughout this project. Lastly, I used more advanced bash and git functions in order to work more effectively.

There is certainly room for improvement within this project. Adding animations to certain elements within the project could bring it more to life and make it more accessible for users while they interact with the webpage, specifically making text or buttons larger on smaller resolution as a user hovers over it or interacts with it to make the element more clear.

I also need to continue to work on understanding grid display. This was the most challenging part of the project for me, so I'd like to continue to learn more on this topic.

Overall, this project was very challenging but rewarding to see it completed. Open to all feedback - feel free to comment!
