**Project Description**

For Project 5 of the TripleTen course, I implemented a variety of different JavaScript functions to bring my website to life. Specfically for this project, I refactored a lot of my html to leverage templates & applied a forEach loop to load all my cards through JS. I also worked on adding new cards through the add card button, updating the like button, deleting cards by adding a trash button and function behind it, and lastly added a preview of the card image with a smooth transition on open and close.

There is certainly room for improvement within this project. I would like to clean up the way I organized my JS functions and group them so there is easier readability as I'm scanning through the workflows. I need to continue to learn more about JS and logic behind how things work, but overall this was a challenging yet rewarding part of the project.

Open to all feedback - feel free to comment!
