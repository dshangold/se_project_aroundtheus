**Project Description**

For Project 5 of the TripleTen course, I implemented a variety of different JavaScript functions to bring my website to life. Specfically for this project, I refactored a lot of my html to leverage templates & applied a forEach loop to load all my cards through JS. I also worked on adding new cards through the add card button, updating the like button, deleting cards by adding a trash button and function behind it, and lastly added a preview of the card image with a smooth transition on open and close.

There is certainly room for improvement within this project. I would like to clean up the way I organized my JS functions and group them so there is easier readability as I'm scanning through the workflows. I need to continue to learn more about JS and logic behind how things work, but overall this was a challenging yet rewarding part of the project.

I also need to continue to work on understanding grid display. This was the most challenging part of the project for me, so I'd like to continue to learn more on this topic.

Overall, this project was very challenging but rewarding to see it completed. Open to all feedback - feel free to comment!
